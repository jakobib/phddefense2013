This ‘Thesenpapier’, required by the doctoral degree regulations to submit in
advance, summarizes the main ideas of the thesis for defense on May 31th, 2013.

# Definitions

1. Data is analyzed as signs, communicated in form of digital documents. 
   These are not studied as potential results of observations or measurements 
   but as created artifacts, eventually given as sequences of bits.

2. Data is structured and described by metadata, which again is data.
   
# Research issues

3. Data structuring and description is visible in a multitude of technologies, 
   standards, languages, rules, and trends. These must be studied as phenomena
   to find out how data is actually structured and described.

4. Common features can be identified in different methods of data
   structuring and description, independent from particular trends 
   and technologies.

# Results

5. A prototype categorization of data structuring can identify the intended 
   purposes of particular data methods and technologies.

6. Fundamental paradigms in data structuring 
   can reveal hidden assumptions and blind spots of data
   methods and their applications.

7. A pattern language shows typical problems and solutions which occur over
   and over again in description and structuring of data, independent from 
   particular trends and technologies.
