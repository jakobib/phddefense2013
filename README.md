This git repository, available at <https://github.com/jakobib/phddefense2013>,
contains documents of my PhD thesis defense ‘Describing data patterns. A
general deconstruction of metadata standards’ at Humboldt University Berlin,
May 31th, 2013. The defense takes 60-90 minutes and consists of a [short
talk](slides.md) (up to 15 minutes) with a [handout](handout.md), followed by
questions & answers.
